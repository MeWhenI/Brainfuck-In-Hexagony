# Brainfuck In Hexagony

A brainfuck interpreter written in [Martin Ender's Hexagony](https://github.com/m-ender/hexagony).

# Specs

Takes brainfuck source code as a command line argument, and input to the brainfuck program as an optional second argument.

Memory is unlimited in both directions from the origin.

Cells are 8-bit wrapping.

Reading a byte after input is exhausted reads a zero byte.
